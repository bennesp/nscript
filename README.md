NOTICE
======

The lines below refer to the original version of the software and have been
left for documentation purpose. Refer to `README.updates.md` for recent
information. Eventually, the two files will be merged.

The new build system is integrated with a Makefile, so that the installation
boils down to the familiar:

    make
    make install

I decided to adopt and refine the code as there was no trace of a website
and it had remained untouched since 2000. All credit for legacy structure
(i.e. what was present at the "Initial Commit" stage) goes to
Enrique Campos-Nanez. See ChangeLog.old for old history (i.e. pre-GIT)

This project is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/esseks/nscript): refer
to that page for opening tickets, requesting features and contacting
the author (well, the present author, Stefano Sanfilippo - Enrique Campos
should be reachable at the email address at the bottom of this file).

The new icon set is taken from GNOME 3 icons, released under GPL.

See AUTHORS for contact information.
