(Mostly) Legal notes applying to the original archive as downloaded from the Internet.
======================================================================================

* The original zipfile was downloaded from:


* I found no reference webpage for this software and last update dates back to
12 years ago. First step was to rationalize source code and move to JDK 1.7
compliance (e.g. all source files were moved in a package)

* All dot files (.DS_store &co.) have been removed: obviously they 
weren't part of the source - they were rather unintentional leaves.

* The package contained no license (seriously): I've assigned a BSD-permissive
license to the package. The original author (Enrique Campos-Nunez) agreed
with this choice.

* Old docs were stripped as outdated and so were the javadocs (and all of the
generated resources).

* For all modifications and fixes please refer to the git log.
