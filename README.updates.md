(Mostly) Legal notes applying to the original archive as downloaded from the Internet.
======================================================================================

* The original zipfile was downloaded from:


* I found no reference webpage for this software and last update dates back to
12 years ago. First step was to rationalize source code and move to JDK 1.7
compliance (e.g. all source files were moved in a package)

* All dot files (.DS_store &co.) have been removed: obviously they 
weren't part of the source - they were rather unintentional leaves.

* The package contains no license (seriously): I've dropped a line to 
the email address specified in the source code, but no evidence whatsoever 
of an answer. Given that - and provided that the source is attached - I 
assume that the original intentions were to open source this piece of 
software and so I will do.

* With reference to the point above, I declare my good faith in open sourcing
this application. I shall not be liable to any extent. Should the original
author want me to withdraw the code from the Internet, I will comply.
Anyway, all the patches, modifications and bug fixes are in my copyright,
so in case of source withdraw the original author will have to remove all of
them from his copy of the software and explicitly renounce to make any profit
over this modifications.

* Old docs were stripped as outdated and so were the javadocs (and all of the
generated resources).

* For all modifications and fixes please refer to the git log.
